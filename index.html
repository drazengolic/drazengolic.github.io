<h3 id="about-me">About me</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a professional software developer for over a decade. I&rsquo;ve started off as a junior web developer tinkering with websites, later doing some application development, but for the past several years I&rsquo;ve been doing mostly server-side and database development.</p>
<p>My roots in software development go way back to the end of elementary school, when I&rsquo;ve discovered QBASIC and Pascal. In my lifetime, I&rsquo;ve discovered and used several programming languages and tools - I&rsquo;ve built desktop apps, web sites, web apps, system integrations, and even some mobile games. I think of myself as a generalist and goal-driven, rather than being a specialist in narrow set of technologies. But that generalism has it&rsquo;s limits though - I&rsquo;m not interested in technologies that are modern but unnecessarily complicated (like the modern web development), so I try to avoid them as much as possible, and always in seek of better ways.</p>
<h3 id="this-blog">This blog</h3>
<p>This is where I&rsquo;ll be posting (mostly technical) things for which I believe are worth sharing with the accidental visitors like yourself. My focus is on tools and techniques that make the simple solutions possible, rather than those that will fill out my CV but also make my hair gray before it&rsquo;s due. So, yes - I&rsquo;m quite <em>opinionated</em> and <em>non-conformist</em>, but I have years of experience to back it up. Therefore I won&rsquo;t allow any comments ðŸ˜„</p>
<h3 id="reaching-out">Reaching out</h3>
<p>In case you want to find out more, or if you think there is a way I could help you (with technology), feel free* to reach out over <a href="https://ba.linkedin.com/in/drazengolic">LinkedIn</a>. You can also follow my rants on <a href="https://twitter.com/Drazen_88">Twitter/X</a> if you like.</p>
<p>* <em>if I decide that your profile looks fishy in any way, you will most likely get ignored. #sorrynotsorry</em></p>
