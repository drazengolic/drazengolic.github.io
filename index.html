<h3 id="about-me">About me</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a professional software developer for over a decade. I&rsquo;ve started off as a junior web developer tinkering with websites, later doing some application development, but for the past several years I&rsquo;ve been doing mostly server-side and database development.</p>
<p>My roots in software development go way back to the end of elementary school, when I&rsquo;ve discovered QBASIC and Pascal. In my lifetime, I&rsquo;ve discovered and used several programming languages and tools - I&rsquo;ve built desktop apps, web sites, web apps, system integrations, and even some mobile games. I think of myself as a generalist and goal-driven, rather than being a specialist in narrow set of technologies. But that generalism has it&rsquo;s limits though - I&rsquo;m not fond of technologies that are unnecessarily complicated (think modern web frameworks), so I try to avoid them whenever possible. But, I&rsquo;m always on the quest of finding better, <strong>simpler</strong> ways to achieve things.</p>
<h3 id="this-blog">This blog</h3>
<p>This is where I&rsquo;ll be posting (mostly technical) things for which I believe are worth sharing with the accidental visitors like yourself, with more focus into <em>doing</em> rather than <em>talking</em>. When it comes to programming, I&rsquo;m a <em>non-conformist</em> and sometimes may look <em>opinionated</em> about things, but opinions change with experience.</p>
