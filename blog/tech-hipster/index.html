<title>On and off the Elixir train - a story of a Tech Hipster | Drazen Golic</title>
<meta name="title" content="On and off the Elixir train - a story of a Tech Hipster" />
<meta name="description" content="Disclaimer
What you&rsquo;re about to read (if you persist) is a personal story, interwined with a lot of opinions. While I try my best to be factualy correct, there is a possibility for lapsus memoriae or to be misinformed about things. With that being said, I hope you&rsquo;ll find this post to be informative, and maybe even amusing.
Motivation
I spent about 2 years working in the Elixir programming language. Where I live, this is a totally unknown piece of technology, and I&rsquo;m being asked about it by both friends and recruiters alike, and also why I stopped doing it. The goal of this post is to explain everything from start to finish." />

  <h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>
<p>What you&rsquo;re about to read (if you persist) is a personal story, interwined with a lot of opinions. While I try my best to be factualy correct, there is a possibility for <em>lapsus memoriae</em> or to be misinformed about things. With that being said, I hope you&rsquo;ll find this post to be informative, and maybe even amusing.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>I spent about 2 years working in the Elixir programming language. Where I live, this is a totally unknown piece of technology, and I&rsquo;m being asked about it by both friends and recruiters alike, and also why I stopped doing it. The goal of this post is to explain everything from start to finish.</p>
<h2 id="a-little-bit-about-me">A little bit about me</h2>
<p>In order for things to make sense, I should give some background.</p>
<p>I started (in late 2009), and spent most of my career, as a PHP web developer. An aspiring Electrical Engineer back then, I entered the workforce since I needed money to continue my studies. There was a demand, it was relatively easy to start, and so I did. As the years gone by, my frustration with the projects I worked on was constantly on the rise. All kinds of terrible code bases (both open and closed source), weird production errors, always the same patterns, stupid CRUD work that somehow manages to get complicated beyond comprehension because of fighting with the frameworks, opinions and ever changing requirements at the same time, not to mention <em>skill issues</em> of everyone involved&hellip; It never felt like engineering, only a hustle to clear the backlog. I thought there must be a way to save myself from all that, so my frustration nudged me into regularly exploring what else is out there, what <em>smart</em> people are doing&hellip; There was another thing that also bugged me - I always wanted to do something that most people around me don&rsquo;t. Some ego trip perhaps, I don&rsquo;t know. Or just being a <em>hipster</em> lol. I did have a few stints in Java, later in C# too, but more on that later.</p>
<h3 id="a-taste-of-functional-programming">A taste of functional programming</h3>
<p>In the late 2012, I discovered, and enrolled into an online MOOC on Coursera called <em>Functional programming principles in Scala</em>. It was a bit tough, as many things were new to me, but I persisted and completed the course. It was an amazing course that also gave me a little bit of taste on how it looks like to have lectures in the world-class universities by the world-class professors, and I enjoyed every bit of it. However, the continuation of the course in 2013 called <em>Principles of Reactive Programming</em> was a show stopper. I couldn&rsquo;t wrap my head around a monad, and with a great dissapointment, decided to quit the course early on.</p>
<h3 id="and-a-bit-of-erlang">&hellip;and a bit of Erlang</h3>
<p>Sometimes during my college years, someone mentioned this language developed by Ericsson that is being used by <em>big</em> institutions like telecoms, banks etc, being well paid and all, and I though <em>&ldquo;Oh, that sounds cool&hellip;&rdquo;</em>. But it took me several years from that moment (some time in 2018, while I was on my break between jobs), to actually look it up and try it out. I learned about the Actor model, the nine nines uptime, and a fun book called <a href="https://learnyousomeerlang.com/">Learn You Some Erlang for great good!</a>. It is also the time when I discovered Elixir as a more approachable Erlang, and all of it felt like it had a good vibe back then for whatever reason. I also really liked what Joe Armstrong (RIP) had to say. And those uptime numbers and resilience certainly resonated with me!</p>
<h3 id="now-back-to-work">Now back to work</h3>
<p>Couple of months later, I landed I nice job that required PHP again. So I&rsquo;ve put learning Erlang aside, and focused on the job. After a while, PHP didn&rsquo;t feel suitable for the things needed to be done, so I used the oportunity to jump into C# and .NET, as it looked good back then - it was open source for some time, Docker containers were all the rage, and there was some great tooling within Visual Studio. Erlang is still somewhere deep in the &ldquo;personal backlog&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="enter-clojure">Enter Clojure</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remeber how or when did I stumble upon Clojure and Rich Hickey, but boy, was it a revelation! A lot of what Rich <a href="https://changelog.com/posts/rich-hickeys-greatest-hits/">said</a> sounded like it was somewhere deep in my mind but presented so eloquently, and I was a fan almost immediately. That&rsquo;s how I learned about &ldquo;decomplecting&rdquo;, practical functional programming, the REPL, immutable data structures and so on.</p>
<p>But, once again, I&rsquo;ve hit a roadblock. Even though everything sounded right, I was too stupid to grok it and put into use. My brain was too deeply wired into procedural thinking (no wonder, after many years of coding before that, and also thinking about efficiency rather than a declarative approach), the LISP syntax was way too strange, and to make things worse - I even tried to use Emacs at the same time! I&rsquo;ve always been a &ldquo;mouse guy&rdquo;, never quite strong with the keyboard shortcuts. Using Emacs felt like it would take me less time to learn to write Mandarin Chinese than all of it&rsquo;s shortcuts. And once again, I decided to &ldquo;drop out&rdquo;, but this time with a lot of lessons learned along the way.</p>
<h3 id="honorable-mentions">Honorable mentions</h3>
<p>Somewhere in this period, after a stint in C#, I also tried to play a little with F#. But it somehow felt like it&rsquo;s a Microsoft&rsquo;s stepchild rather than a first-class citizen, and it didn&rsquo;t stick with me.</p>
