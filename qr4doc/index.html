Description
A short-lived SaaS developed for validation, supplemental information, and notification on change for printed documents, originally intended for insurance policies.
It generates a unique link that gets embedded in the document in the form of a QR code. Scanning the code and opening the link will display a document summary (for all it&rsquo;s versions) for a visual comparison of important document elements as a method of checking if the print is a fraud copy or obsolete. The page can also contain multiple web links (think Linktree) relevant for the document, and visitors can subscribe for notifications on new document versions, or the change of it&rsquo;s status if it has any." />
