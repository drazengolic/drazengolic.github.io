      <description>About this site Hello, and welcome to my blog where I&#39;ll be writing about my tech ventures - both small and large, but also about stuff that I&#39;m interested in in general. This is both a learning experience and applying of what I already know.
The blog will mostly be centered around general problem-solving, and functional-first programming languages such as F# and in a lesser extent OCaml.
You won&#39;t be able to comment, but I do welcome quality feedback nevertheless.</description>

      <description>Some time ago while I was in the college, we&#39;ve got a task for homework to implement a class in C++ that will represent a large positive number. The large number will have a predefined maximum number of digits (i.e. 50), and it should support addition and multiplication operations via operator overloading.
As someone who is learning a language somewhat different than what he&#39;s used to, I&#39;ve decided to revisit that task and do the same in F#, but with few differences:</description>
