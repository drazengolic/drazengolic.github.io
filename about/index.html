    <h3 id="about-me">About me</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a professional software developer for over 11 years. I&rsquo;ve started off as a junior web developer tinkering with websites, later doing some application development, but for the past several years I&rsquo;ve been doing mostly server-side and database development.</p>
<p>My roots in software development go way back to the end of elementary school, when I&rsquo;ve discovered QBASIC and Pascal. In my lifetime, I&rsquo;ve put my hands on several programming languages and tools - I&rsquo;ve built desktop apps, web sites, web apps, system integrations, and even some mobile games. I think of myself as a generalist and goal-driven, rather than being a specialist in narrow set of technologies. But that generalism has it&rsquo;s limits though - I tend to stay away from insufferable world of modern UI development, but also from false promises of many other tech <em>du jour</em> whose number seems to have exploded in recent years.</p>
<h3 id="this-blog">This blog</h3>
<p>This is where I&rsquo;ll be posting (mostly technical) things for which I believe are worth sharing with the accidental visitors like yourself. My focus is on tools and techniques that make the simple solutions possible, rather than those that will fill out my CV but also make my hair gray before it&rsquo;s due. So, yes - I&rsquo;m quite <em>opinionated</em> and <em>non-conformist</em>, but I have years of experience to back it up. Therefore I won&rsquo;t allow any comments ðŸ˜„</p>
<h3 id="reaching-out">Reaching out</h3>
<p>In case you want to find out more, or if you think there is a way I could help you, feel free* to reach out over <a href="https://ba.linkedin.com/in/drazengolic">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<p>* <em>if I decide that your profile looks fishy in any way, you will most likely get ignored. #sorrynotsorry</em></p>
